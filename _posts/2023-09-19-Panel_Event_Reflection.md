During this event, I have learned a lot about the process of applying to college and finding internships as a computer science major. Many of the panel speakers today did not enter college as a computer science major, but rather as something adjacent to the major, since computer science is a very competitive major. Additionally, computer science is a lottery system for many schools, so majoring in something could potentially give you more options while also being involved in computer science. Projects are very important to aid college applications as well as finding an internship. If the internship shows commitment towards computer science or if a project that you developed has an impact, it can heavily benefit your application.
