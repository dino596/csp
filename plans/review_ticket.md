## Key Contributions to our Passion Project

### Frontend
In my role on the frontend team, I played a crucial part in ensuring the quality and user experience of our web application. I actively contributed by meticulously testing the frontend and diligently pointing out issues and potential improvements. By conducting thorough tests, I identified various user interface inconsistencies, functional bugs, and performance issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Through clear and detailed feedback, I enabled the team to address these issues promptly, enhancing the overall user experience. My commitment to ensuring a seamless and visually appealing interface helped create a more user-friendly environment, demonstrating my dedication to the project's success and the satisfaction of our users.

### Backend
In the initial stages of our project, I played a pivotal role in shaping the backend infrastructure. I took the initiative by creating the original repository and jumpstarting our API development. Leveraging the example APIs provided with Jason, I meticulously crafted the foundation of our backend operations. This involved not just copying and pasting but understanding the intricacies of each API, ensuring they seamlessly integrated into our system. My efforts laid the groundwork for our backend, establishing the fundamental pathways through which our application would operate.

As our project evolved, so did our backend requirements. We made a strategic decision to transition from our original API format to utilizing SQL databases. This shift was driven by the need for a more accessible and scalable solution. SQL databases provided us with a robust framework, offering enhanced data management capabilities and improved accessibility for both developers and end-users. Embracing this new technology allowed us to streamline our backend processes, ensuring a more efficient and reliable experience for everyone involved.

During the transition and subsequent testing phase, we encountered significant challenges. Testing the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions is integral to ensuring the reliability and functionality of any backend system. We faced hurdles that tested our problem-solving skills and patience. Issues cropped up, and at times it seemed like a daunting task to get all these functions working seamlessly together. However, through relentless perseverance and collaborative teamwork, we overcame these difficulties. Through rigorous testing, debugging, and continuous refinement, we managed to resolve the issues, ensuring that our backend operations were not only functional but also optimized for performance. This experience not only strengthened our technical expertise but also underscored the importance of teamwork and determination in overcoming complex challenges in the world of backend development.

### DevOps and Deployment
As a dedicated backend programmer, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the synergy between our development teams. Working closely with Matthew, our skilled DevOps engineer, I collaborated on testing procedures and streamlined communication channels between the frontend and backend systems. My expertise in backend technologies allowed me to optimize the backend infrastructure, ensuring seamless data flow and efficient processing. Together with Matthew, we established robust protocols that facilitated effective communication between the frontend and backend teams.

### Important Commits
[Commit on 10/8](https://github.com/dino596/test_api/commit/c0d05f59d5c010da7ef3b0d3f81070030ebe9e5d) <br>
- This was my initial commit after creating a new repository to test the SQL database. This was a very simple API with only GET method.

[Commit on 10/9](https://github.com/dino596/test_api/commit/b6aebc4584c7f96ff06bc67d861122d77c37ef1c) <br>
- This was my commit where I added soulsList, which could function with GET to access the entire database rather than transmitting one object at a time.

[Commit on 10/13](https://github.com/dino596/test_api/commit/d8890635b5bf9836d158370d7f57c35e6b9e9af1) <br>
- This commit was very important, since I added the foundation to the (non functional at the time) POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I would later test them and realize that POST and DELETE worked, but PUT did not work, prompting me to submit a Github Issue about the subject.

[Commit on 10/15](https://github.com/dino596/test_api/commit/20cf033878d91abfb74edd3a305ced8ea088942a) <br>
- I fixed the PUT method in this commit, meaning that the API was now fully functional.

[Commit on 10/16](https://github.com/dino596/JARMIRAMJI/commit/921328c6ee2007743b0838809c35a9181f2ec1b4) <br>
- I migrated my old API onto the new repository, and we worked on another API for characters instead of classes.

### Issues
[Issue on 10/15](https://github.com/dino596/test_api/issues/1) <br>
- This was the issue that I created in order to signal to myself that I needed to fix the PUT method. Later, I fixed the PUT method, and Jason confirmed it by testing it with Postman.
